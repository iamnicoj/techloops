Events: A and B

Area of each represents relative probaility

Overlapping area {A or B} = A U B

A Intersection B probaility:

>P(A and B) = P(A) P(B Given A) = P(B) P(A Given B)

Universe = Range(10)

```
P {1..5} = 5/10 = 1/2
P {Even given P {1..5}} = 2/5

P (even AND x <= 5) = P {1..5} * P {Even given P {1..5}} 
                    = 1/2 * 2/5
                    = 2/10 = 1/5
```

## BAYES' Theorem

> P(A Given B) = P(A) P(B Given A) / P(B)

P of the any
> P (A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A Given B)
As we need to remove the intersation to be added double
